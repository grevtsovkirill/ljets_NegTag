* Inputs:
** Uses Ntuples produced by Ines and Kristian
   - Are be defined in ../config/mc_files.txt and ../config/data_files.txt
   - Pattern: "slice/dataPeriod" "list of space separated samples"
   - Usually you either have to download the Ntuples or replicate them to your local group disk
* Outputs:
** Skimmed and slimmed Ntuples
   - res/data<period>.root
   - res/mc<slice>.root
   - can contain systematic variations as separate trees
** "magic files"
*** contain information about which slice/period/systematics were run on (written by run.sh)
    - .periods.auto"
    - .slices.auto"
    - .systematics.auto"
