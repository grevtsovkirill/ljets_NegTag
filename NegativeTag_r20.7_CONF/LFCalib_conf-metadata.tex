\AtlasAbstract{%
A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify jets originating from $b$-quark hadronization within the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. We describe two measurements of the misidentification rate of jets containing no $b$- nor $c$-hadrons for the algorithm most commonly used in the LHC Run~2 ATLAS analyses. The measurements are performed in various ranges of jet transverse momenta and pseudorapidities based on proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of ${\sqrt{s} = 13}$~TeV during the year 2015 and 2016. The first measurement is based on a data sample enriched in jets originating from light-flavour quark and gluon hadronization with the application of a dedicated algorithm reversing some of the criteria used in the nominal identification algorithm. The second measurement is based on a bottom-up approach where the underlying tracking variables in the simulation are adjusted to match the data. The effect is then propagated to the high-level observables relevant for $b$-identification. The results of both methods are found in good agreement and compared to the misidentification rate predicted by the nominal ATLAS simulation in order to calibrate it.
