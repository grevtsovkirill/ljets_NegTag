1) run CalculateVariables - for that need to check that all necessary variations done at NtupleReader

compile rel_syst, and run it for different keys (still not sure that it's correct):
  ./rel_syst -s generator -v sf -t rel
  this produce output:rel_systematics/rel_sf_generator.root 

./rel_syst -s khf
  ./rel_syst -s sf
  ./rel_syst -s sf_neg


./total_syst -s generator -v sf (kll, khf, eps_neg_d)
